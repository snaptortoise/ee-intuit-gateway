## Intuit/Quickbook Gateway for Event Espresso

This module allows you to use the Intuit/Quickbooks gateway with your Event Espresso installation. It's rough but functional. You have to hard-code your keys at the moment and the code could be cleaned up significantly.

**I welcome your pull requests.** I know a lot of other people have been looking for this so please help to make it better!
